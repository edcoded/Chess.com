For those frustrated by chess.com's recent review game changes, the following is a set of instructions to allow you to once again see both the 'Move Played' and 'Best Move' Bubbles at the same time when reviewing your games.

1). Install TamperMonkey browser extension

2). Enable developer mode: Go to;    chrome://extensions    there's a button in the top right corner.

3). Click on TamperMonkey extension and select 'Create a new script...'

4). Copy the code included and replace what's shown in the TamperMonkey editor with it.

5). *** IMPORTANT *** go to a game, click ' Start Review' and then once you go get to Move 1 (move=1) REFRESH THE PAGE!

6). This should create the space required to see both Move Bubbles at the same time going forward. (to begin with the extra space is a little redundant as there often isn't a best move to show in the opening but you'll just have to live with that)

7). The Code, copy the below and make sure that // ==UserScript== is on line 1 of the TamperMonkey editor, adjust the spacing as per the image included if need be.
